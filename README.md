Our templates offer a rich boilerplate to jump start Rails-based application development and are based on our experience 
with building complex applications over the years.

## Get Started

The main template is `rails_docker`. In order to use it, initialize a new app with the following parameters:

```
rails new < app_name > -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nimblehq/rails-templates/master/rails_docker.rb -T
```

Read more about Rails Application Template in the [official Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/rails_application_templates.html).
